          <h2>Effective the 1st of June, 2017, Sora League is closing down. The server itself will be operational until the 1st of July, where it, too will be terminated. </h2>
          <p>
But if you're here, you probably already knew that. Hey there. 
<br><br>
It's been quite the run, hasn't it? It's been a nice, long journey, somehow mostly free of the drama that is usually synonymous with the existence of a Pokemon Showdown league. I, too, have racked up a portfolio of fond memories with this server. 
<br><br>
My first drawing for Sora, which lead to the creation of more drawings, and then a website, and somehow ended with a seat on the Admin Team.
<br><br>
The Whimsicott that singlehandedly earned me my first position... And the Crobat that singlehandedly reminded me of my place. You know who you are. Noah.
<br><br>
And of course, that blasted Togekiss. Serene Grace Air Slash is definitely fair and balanced, and that Elite Four position was definitely not stolen from under my nose. 
<br><br>
These are fond memories that I don't quite want to let go of. Not yet. Not now. After all, why would I? Sora has been a second home. These memories have resulted in amazing friends in this small community of ours. People who are always up for a nice conversation. People who are always willing to theorycraft, no matter how utterly idiotic the idea is. People who helped me grow, both as a player and as a person. 
<br><br>
But let's be real here. All good things have to come to an end, and Sora is no exception. In my roughly three and a half years, I've been in every single role that's possible to attain. Even ones that you didn't know existed. Yes, Gym Trainer is a role. Most of you probably never even heard of that one. During that time, I've seen Sora rising, Sora at its peak... And of course, I've also seen it slowly descend. 
<br><br>
People just lose interest over time. I am no exception. Personally, as a gamer, I seek the reward of skill and telegraphed RNG over the fickle heart of lady luck. A clear means of improvement, a system that makes it obvious that I've gotten better and rewards me for it. A healthy, helpful community that does not seek to alienate. Sadly, Pokemon did not provide any of these, and as many have done before me, I drifted away from the game. That last point doesn't count. "Non-toxic video game community" is a blatant oxymoron, and even as a third-language English speaker that was obvious to me. 
<br><br>
But that doesn't mean the bonds we have forged have to die with the server's closure. For one, the Discord server will still be open (link below). Most of us will still be there, including all members of the Admin Team. The league may have ended, but the community does not have to go along with it. And personally, I hope the friendships we all have shaped together will stay for much longer than Sora ever will. 
<br><br>
Additionally, this site, is also here to stay. Maybe it'll serve as a memento of sorts. Who knows? Maybe one day, I'll look back at this page and be reminded of how horrible I was with a tablet pen and HTML. 
<br><br>
Sora League was started as an act of spite. It survived four long years, and that couldn't have been done without all you amazing people. I am merely the newest member of the Admin Team; my position no more than a token laurel, adding absolutely nothing worthwhile to the league itself. However, I would like to momentarily be so outrageous as to thank every single one of you on behalf of the Admin Team. Thank you. Thank you for being a part of Sora. Thank you for being a challenger. Thank you for being an Gym Leader. Thank you for being an Elite Four, or a Frontier. For building Sora into what it is, from the bottom of my heart: truly, thank you.
<br><br>
After all, "hello" is just the beginning of another "goodbye". I hope we meet again.
<br><br>
