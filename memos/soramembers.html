                Ladies and gay cunts (mainly risu) I don't talk often but I think I should say this, but I kinda love most of you (not risu tho he gay) but Sora has been a place for me to feel comfortable from real life issues, as only some of you (Ateam) know, something happened that almost made me leave, my mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Terminal Lung Cancer and I honestly would like to say a personally thank you to both Blade and Risu for being some top blokes for helping me through that.
                <br><br>
                I don't wanna be gay like Risu but I would like to say thank to most of you cheers for being apart of something as great as this, I hope the best for all of you in the future.
                <br><br>
                I'll try my best to keep in contact as much as I can and I will continue being as Heat as always if PU comes out but only time will tell.

                Even back when I first joined as Melody, I was making memories that would last. I never thought they'd become something I have to treasure, so soon. And when I returned, now as Luscinia...
                <br><br>
                I can't say it wasn't fun. Between the first few tours, where I showed Comfey's might, clear through to now, where I've made a new team, full of bad meme. I couldn't have done any of it without most of the a-team backing me up, even if it never seemed like it.
                <br><br>
                This place, this league, it meant a lot for me. And while it's sad to see it go like this, it's time to let go of the past. They're right, the era of leagues is over. But one thing I'll never forget, is how I helped influence this place for the better. And I'll never forget all of you.
                <br><br>
                Keep your Melody going, everyone... And spread your wings. Be proud.

                I havent visited much recently bc real lifes a bitch and im moving out in october, but im going to be sad to see the place go, theres a lot of old members here id like to stay in touch with and even with how busy shits been ive tried to come on at least a couple times a month to see how the leagues doing and say a quick hi to noah and anyone whose on.
                <br><br>
                This place was a very big part of my life at one point when i lived in ringwood didnt have many friends i was antisocial and people there were dicks, sora was the family id chosen, and while ive been in and out of the league i didnt consider the idea of it ever not existing.
                <br><br>
                I'm grateful the discord still exists though so the option to stay in contact exists when we can, there has been a lot of good memories to hold onto though, like the ipl's and vgc, so im glad it was worth it for you as well

                For as much crap I had for the league, I honestly had a great time in it as a leader, but also as a student. A lot of great competitive battlers reside here, and I eas fortunate enough to watch and learn from them.
                <br><br>
                Neith, you gave me the hook up, and though we've kinda distanced ourselves, I appreciate what you did for this league, for the people that it's brought together. Thank you Noah for putting up with the shit I pulled.
                <br><br>
                Again, thank you all for not only bettering myself as a player, but also as a person in general. Sora will be missed.

                Wow.... I honestly can not believe that sora is shutting down. Tbh I probably should have guessed after talking to risu last night.
                <br><br>
                Sora has affected me in so many ways for the better, and has changed me to not be the young idiot that I used to be when I first challenged the league. Going from the young person with a UU Team (still no regrets) struggling to beat a single frontier member to the Elite Frontier  with the exact same team (I wonder how many of you noticed). Sora has given me so many opportunities to further myself as a person and I can not thank you all enough for everything you all have done. I want to say a quick apology to all those ive made salty over the years, I never meant it in a malicious way, only just a friendly way.
                <br><br>
                Thank you to Noah and Risu who served as my mentors, and showed me the way I could get better and improve myself. Thank you to Neith, thou we may have started off on sour grounds, we learned to not hate each other and youve taught a lot to me to further myself (and to not judge people so quickly).
                <br><br>
                Thank you to Onyx and Jeratt for helping my throughout my time here, and always being willing to help out anyone that needed it.
                <br><br>
                Thank you to Blade for giving me the amazing opportunity to be in charge of the Game Corner, you seriously dont know how much that helped me on the day you made the announcement (mental health stuff sucks :/), and thank you for keeping the server going, youve done an amazing job! Seriously though, thank you so much for keeping the server alive through your endless struggles through the land of coding.
                <br><br>
                And lastly... Tempest... probably someone that hated me for moments during my time in Sora.. especially with my imfamous togekiss. Ahh the memories of making everyone, but especially you salty. From there though, I think that I have learned so much from you, and I consider you a friend of mine. Thank you also for the opportunity to work on an art collab with you for sora, even if it stressed you out and you had to do most of the work ;).
                <br><br>
                Thank you also to some of my friends whilst I was on sora such as night, temp, silvy, blade, mitsuka, meows, zach and leaf. You have all helped me grow into who I am today and your continuous support makes me so grateful.
                <br><br>
                Though it may sound like it, I am not leaving this discord anytime soon, im still going to continue to annoy you all through memes and politics, so you all have that to look forward to :)
                <br><br>
                Apologies if I missed anyone, you all have been so nice to me and I hope I can continue to talk to you all towards the future :)

                But I do wanna thank BlakJack for inviting me. I have always wished you luck in a pokemon game, but now I want to wish you good luck in the other game, the game of life.

                You know, ever since I joined this league, I had a strong feeling about this place. It was filled with good people and ever since I joined, I always thought to myself, "This sure is a nice place. I hope it doesn't die off like some of the other leagues I saw." Now it has come to farewell.
                <br><br>
                I wasn't active ever since I entered the hell which is known as the IB Course. But you know what, despite me being inactive and having other complicated personal stuff in my life, this place was always a good place to visit. You guys were basically another family to me. This place has a special place in my heart. I'll never forget those days when this place was at its prime when I was around.
                <br><br>
                It greatly saddens me to see this league go away. I can't put it to words such as thank you. No, it deserves better than thank you. I would say that this place changed my life. Who would have thought that this place would have lasted for 4 years? I sure didn't, but you know, all the more reason as to why I'm going to miss it so much. I really will miss all of you guys.
                <br><br>
                Thank you to Onyx for helping me out so much in the League when I started out as a Rock Leader.
                <br>
                Thank you to Noah for all the good memories.
                <br>
                Thank you to Bart for being a good friend to talk to when it came to DOTA 2 and other stuff.

                Thank you to Risu who is an overall amazing guy.
                <br>
                Thank you to Tempest for all the funny jokes, current artworks, and the stuff you did.
                <br>
                Thank you to Neith for making this League come true.
                <br>
                Thank you to Youmaton for being one of the greatest veterans of this league.

                Thank you to Jeratt for doing all the artworks before.
                <br>
                Thank you to Night for being one of the oldest members that I've been with ever since I joined.
                <br>
                Thank you to Blade for making this server run well and also for that april fools video with that sick meme of you crashing the server as Bane 😀
                <br><br>
                I'm pretty sure I missed a lot of the others, but I think you get the idea. You guys truly changed a part of my life and all I can hope is that we can continue to communicate with each other in the future.
