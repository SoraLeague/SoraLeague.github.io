                I've been with some of the guys since Biblia league, and with Sora since it was remade from the ashes of the upper mentioned league. I've been an admin of Sora for I don't even know how long and left this winter, because I was struggling to dedicate enough time to this.
                <br><br>
                First of all, I'm just gonna throw this out here, I consider all of you good friends and am available to just chat or play OW on EU servers anytime. As I told Heat, I consider this surreal that it's kind of surreal realizing you know some people on the internet since like 13-14 and you care about them even though you've never met them.
                <br><br>
                I still remember how fucking frightened I was when suddenly some dude told me to join his league on a website I've been playing pokemon at for like a month. It didn't help that the league was named biblia, I seriously thought it was a sect or smt. I didn't have my computer back then, so I could only come online whenever I was visiting my grandmother, who I would sometimes fight to use the PC lol.
                <br><br>
                Then a lot of shit happened and I arrived at Sora, as a frontier, in a new and cool server that didn't need me searching for my leaguemates in the main lobby or typing in something to enter the league room. Not gonna talk about what happened next, cuz most of the people reading this were there with me.
                <br><br>
                It's just, so many milestones and events(good and bad) happened to me during these years: My grandpa passing away, me viciously practicing for entrance exams, me getting my own PC, me getting accepted to uni, playing IPL matches from the uni library, 3-4 birthdays and the same amount of new years celebrated with you guys. And I want to thank you, for being there and having fun with me, because after so much time, I legit cannot recall being seriously stressed about anything that happened in the league. Thank you.
                <br><br>
                Special mentions to: the boys, memes, heat sets, intellectual conversations, beef with other leagues/servers, hype tournaments, IPL(!!!), the ~, hype champ battles, the !u command and I'm sure a lot more
                <br><br>
                Thanks ya'll
                <br>
                Your friend,
                <br><br>
