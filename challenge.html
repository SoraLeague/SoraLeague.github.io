	<h2>How Do I Start a Challenge?</h2><br>
		<hr class="primary"><br>
			<p>First of all, register your team of 6 to a member of the Admin Team. Admin Team names are highlighted in the userlist, as shown in the image below.<br>
			If you don't know what registering means, don't worry; just PM an Admin Team member, and they'll gladly help you out from there.</p>
			<p><img src="img/challenge_1.png"></p>
			<p>These six Pok√©mon are to remain the same throughout most of your challenge. This lock only applies on species and form, however.<br>
			You're allowed to change EVs, movesets, and nicknames, and there won't be an issue with your challenge.<br>
			Changing your team of 6 is allowed, but you forfeit all the badges you acquired up to that point.</p>
			<p><img src="img/challenge_2.png"></p>
			<p>Leaders And Elite 4s are challenged using the League Battle format. This format differs from standard OU in that Monotype unbans are<br>
			lifted for Leaders. This allows Leaders to hold their ground against Monotype bans, which are also lifted for the Challenger, but not the Leader.<br>
			If you need information regarding a League member, you can always use the following commands in the server: /[name] or /[type] (e.g. /revan). </p>
			<p><img src="img/challenge_3.png"></p>
			<p>After winning a league battle, remember to click Save Replay. This is crucial, as you need to show a link to the replay to a member of the<br>
			Admin Team. Doing so will earn you server bucks (currencies) depending on the rank of the member you defeated, as well as add up to your<br>
			overall badge count. Defeating one Gym Leader earns you one badge, so keep this in mind. Don't worry about doing anything if you lose,<br>
			as your opponent will take care of everything. However, you cannot challenge the same league member for a whole 24 hours.</p>
			<p><img src="img/challenge_4.png"></p>
			<p>Upon collecting 8 Gym Badges, a challenger can move on to challenge the Frontiers. Defeating a Frontier earns you a Frontier Symbol.<br>
			2 Frontier Symbols are needed to move on to the Elite Four, while 4 Frontier Symbols are required to move on to the Elite Frontiers.<br>
			All 4 Frontier Symbols and 2 Elite Frontier symbols are required to challenge the Frontier Head. If one loses to the second Elite Frontier they<br>
			challenge or the Frontier Head, the challenger must forfeit one Frontier Symbol and one Elite Frontier symbol. During the Frontier stage of<br>
			the challenge, challengers are not locked to any single team, and are free to change teams to adhere to the rulesets.</p>
			<p><img src="img/challenge_5.png"></p>	
			<p>Challengers have to defeat all Elite 4 members consecutively, without fail. Suffering defeat in the hands of an Elite 4 member resets your Elite 4<br>
			run, and you have to try again from the first Elite 4. There is no set order in which the Elite 4s need to be challenged, though. You're allowed<br>
			to register a new team at any point in your E4 challenge, but doing so forfeits all your E4 wins thus far.</p>	
			<p>Defeating all 4 Elite 4 members allows challengers to battle the Soran Champion, as well as granting them the Voice (+) rank. Losing to<br>
			one means you have to rebattle the Elite 4 again. However, there is no set order in which you have to battle the Champions. During the<br>
			Champions stage of the challenge, challengers are not locked to any single team, and are free to change teams to adhere to the rulesets.</p>				
			<p><img src="img/challenge_6.png"></p>	
			<p>To enter the Hall of Fame, challengers must defeat both Champions and the Frontier Head, though there is no specific order in which this needs to be done.</p>
