	<h2>Inclement Weather</h2><br>
		<hr class="primary"><br>
			<p>The Inclement Weather format adds in a new weather type: <b>Acid Rain!</b><br>
			New items and abilities were added to complement this new weather type. Changes were made to existing abilities<br>
			to work differently with Acid Rain, too!<br><br>
			Acid Rain's effects are as follows: <br><br>
			- All Pokémon take <b>1/16 of their maximum health in damage every turn</b>, except if they are Poison-type or Steel-type<br>
			- <b>Gunk Shot's accuracy</b> is locked at 100%<br>
			- <b>Ground-type attacks</b> have their power reduced by 50%<br>
			- <b>Poison-type Pokémon</b> get a 50% increase to their Defense<br><br>
			
			Inclement Weather adds the following abilities:<br>
			- <b>Contamination:</b> When this Pokémon enters the battlefield, the weather becomes Acid Rain for 5 turns<br>
			- <b>Acid Rush:</b> When in Acid Rain, this Pokémon's Speed is doubled<br>
			- <b>High Molar:</b> When in Acid Rain, this Pokémon's STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) is increased from 50% to 100%<br>
			- <b>Toxic Overdrive:</b> When in Acid Rain, this Pokémon gains 1.3x Attack and Special Attack, but loses 1/8 of its maximum health every turn<br>
			- <b>Chemical Regeneration:</b> When in Acid Rain, this Pokémon heals 1/16 of its maximum health every turn, and is immune to Acid Rain damage<br><br>
			
			Inclement Weather adds the following move and item:<br>
			- <b>Contaminate (Move):</b> For 5 turns, the weather becomes Acid Rain<br>
			- <b>Molar Rock (Item):</b> When Acid Rain is invoked by a Pokmon holding this item, the weather lasts for 8 turns instead of 5<br><br>
			
			Inclement Weather interacts with the following moves and abilities:<br>
			- <b>Weather Ball (Move):</b> Power doubles, and becomes Poison-type<br>
			- <b>Immunity (Ability):</b> Negates Acid Rain residual damage<br>
			- <b>Poison Heal (Ability):</b> Heals the user by 1/16 of its maximum health each turn<br>
			- <b>Toxic Boost (Ability):</b> Boosts physical attacks by 1.3x when in Acid Rain<br><br>
			
			The full list of Pokémon who get these abilities and moves can be found <b><a href="http://pastebin.com/7ZpyK7R4">here</a></b>.<br><br>
			
			Since Sora doesn't have its own custom client, some workarounds are necessary to use the new moves and abilities.<br>
			To do so, you need to change them manually from the Import/Export section. Make sure the format selected is Inclement Weather, too!</p>
			
			<p><img src="img/inclement_1.png"></p>
			
			<p>From here, you can manually change the ability and moves to a custom one. Save after that, and you're good to go!</p>

	<h2>Priomons</h2><br>
		<hr class="primary"><br>
			<p>Priority moves have been a great boon to many Pokémon, but its distribution and variety feels somewhat lacking. This format aims to fix that.<br>
			A few priority moves were distributed more, while new priority moves were created for other types.<br><br>
			
			The following is a list of the changes in this format:<br><br>
			
			<b><u>Pre-existing Moves</u></b><br>
			- <b>Fairy Wind:</b> 40 BP | 100% Acc | Special | Fairy-type | Priority: +1 | Usually goes first<br>
			- <b>Aqua Jet:</b> Distribution extended to include Swampert<br>
			- <b>Mach Punch:</b> Distribution extended to include Darmanitan<br><br>
			
			<b><u>New Moves</u></b><br>
			- <b>Flame Shot:</b> 40 BP | 100% Acc | Physical | Fire-type | Priority: +1 | Usually goes first<br>
			- <b>Nerve Pulse:</b> 40 BP | 90% Acc | Special | Electric-type | Priority: +1 | Always results in a Critical Hit<br>
			- <b>Tremor Shock:</b> 30 BP | 100% Acc | Physical | Ground-type | Priority: +1 | Removes stat boosts<br>
			- <b>Diving Charge:</b> 60 BP | 100% Acc | Physical | Flying-type | Priority: +1 | User suffers 25% recoil<br>
			- <b>Venom Strike:</b> 30 BP | 95% Acc | Physical | Poison-type | Priority: +1 | 30% chance to badly poison the target<br>
			- <b>Sap Blast:</b> 40 BP | 100% Acc | Physical | Grass-type | Priority: +1 | Usually goes first<br>
			- <b>Stone Spine:</b> 55 BP | 90% Acc | Physical | Rock-type | Priority: +1 | Usually goes first<br>
			- <b>Draco Crash:</b> 50 BP | 90% Acc | Physical | Dragon-type | Priority: +2 | Nearly always goes first<br>
			- <b>Kinetic Force:</b> 50 BP | 90% Acc | Special | Psychic-type | Priority: +1 | Usually goes first<br><br>
			
			The full list of Pokémon who get these moves can be found <b><a href="http://pastebin.com/TeCicaKj">here</a></b>.<br><br>
			
			Since Sora doesn't have its own custom client, some workarounds are necessary to use the new moves.<br>
			To do so, you need to change them manually from the Import/Export section. Make sure the format selected is Priomons, too!</p>
			
			<p><img src="img/priomons_1.png"></p>
			
			<p>From here, you can manually change the first slot of the moves to a custom one.<br>
			Do note that the Priomons move needs to be on the first slot, nowhere else, or it won't work properly.<br>
			Save after that, and you're good to go!</p>

	<h2>Pokemon Sandbox</h2><br>
		<hr class="primary"><br>
			<p>Pokémon Sandbox is a combination of STABmons, Hackmons, Ability Shift, and Tier Shift, with some additional rules mixed in.<br>
			If this confuses you, don't worry! Here are the exact rules for this format: <br><br>
			
			- A Pokémon is allowed to use <b>any move it naturally learns</b>, and <b>any move that matches its type</b><br>
			- A Pokémon is allowed to use <b>any ability it naturally gets</b>, or <b>any ability that comes before of after said ability in alphabetical order</b><br>
			- Mega Pokémon <b>can hold items other than their Mega Stones</b>; just pick the Mega form from the teambuilder<br>
			- All Pokémon <b>above Smogon OU</b> are <b>banned, with the following exceptions</b>:<br>
			Mega Mawile, Aegislash, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gengar, Mega Lucario, Shaymin-Sky, Genesect, Deoxys-Speed. Deoxys-Defense<br>
			- Regigigas and Slaking are <b>banned</b>
			- Wonder Guard is banned from <b>all Pokémon barring Shedinja</b></p>
