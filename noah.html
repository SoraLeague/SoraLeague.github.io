            <h3>"Sora has always been a great escape for me. A good way for me to get away fom everything in real life and just lose myself in the fictional ongoings of an online community. Little did I know shit would get as real as it did, and I'd meet some quality people along the way."</h3>
            <p>
                After 4 long years, like with all things Sora will be coming to a close. It's been a long and crazy adventure, with me meeting and making numerous friends around not only Australia but the world.
                <br><br>
                The reasoning for this closure should seem obvious to everyone here in staff, we're not as active as we used to be.
                <br>
                The tournaments have less participation, the lobby is less active, we don't get as many if any new members anymore, the Admin Team members mostly no longer play the game either with all of us having different real life commitments.
                <br><br>
                The age of leagues has come to an end. This adventure could not have been possible without each and every single one of you working tirelessly, I cannot thank everyone individually since there are so damn many of you.
                But for everyone who's made this place something for anyone to be welcome you have my thanks. This server will forever be one of my proudest accomplishments, and it pains me to have to close it but it's no longer worth running.
                <br><br>
                The League is closed effective immediately. Sora as a server will remain active until 1/7/17, at which point the plug will be pulled and Sora will be deactivated forever.
                <br><br>
                Thank you everyone, from the bottom of my heart. I love you all.
