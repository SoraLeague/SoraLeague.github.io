	<h2>How Do I Start a Challenge?</h2><br>
		<hr class="primary"><br>
			<p><b>Before we begin, one thing must be emphasized: We have a very strict anti-multileaguing policy!</b><br>
			Multileaguing is the act of being in more than one League at any given period of time. If you are already in another league and wish to join<br>
			Sora, you have to pick one of the two. You are also not to join any other league as long as you're a member of the Sora League. This does not<br>
			count for applicants who were past members of other leagues, and is currently no longer a member.<br>
			If you multileague, you will be found out, and you will be kicked out of Sora.</p>
			<p><b>Sora is a community before it is a league.</b><br>
			We retain the right to revoke or outright refuse granting membership to users we deem toxic.<br>
			Though hopefully this won't happen much, it is a right we readily will evoke when necessary.<br>
			Don't worry, though, it takes a lot to tick us off. Most of the time.</p>
			<p>First of all, you need a type before you become a Gym Leader or Trainer. You can check the <a href="leaders.html">Gym Leaders page</a> to see which type is free, or<br>
			apply to become a Gym Trainer on an occupied type instead. The latter is not generally recommended, however.</p>
			<p>Once you picked a type, PM a member of the A-Team, and express your interest in joining. They will then test you for your specified type,<br>
			which may range from two to three different type weakness tests. A-Team members have their name highlighted in the server's namelist, as<br>
			shown below. Make sure you already have a team! Do note that only A-Team members can test others, unless otherwise specified by one.</p>
			<p><img src="img/join_1.png"></p>
			<p>During these tests, applicants are not allowed to change their teams in any manner, shape, and/or form. Winning is not necessary to secure a<br>
			position (after all, they're all weakness tests), and instead your goal is to impress the person testing you.</p>
			<p><img src="img/join_2.png"></p>
			<p>If you pass the tests, you can then proceed to get a Gym Leader alt of your choice, which hopefully wouldn't have been taken yet. The correct<br>
			format for this is ∆Sora [name]∆. Someone will then promote you to the appropriate rank. You can also do /symbols after you are<br>
			promoted, and you'll automatically get the symbols added into your name. </p>
			<p><img src="img/join_3.png"></p>
			<p>If a member was kicked, or left the league three times, they aren't allowed to rejoin.<br>
			Very rarely, special circumstances may be accepted after a discussion between the members of the A-Team.</p>
			<p><b>Gym Leaders are allowed to change types.</b><br>
			They need to pass another test for their new type, and if the spot they're after has another leader occupying it,<br>
			the leader may be challenged to a Best of Three. The winner gets the position competed for.</p>
			<p><b>There are monthly tournaments for Gym Leaders aspiring to be Elite 4 or Frontier members.</b><br>
			These tournaments are held on the 1st to 7th (E4 Tour) and 8th to 14th (Frontier Tour), respectively. Championing any of these<br>
			tours will allow Gym Leaders to challenge a person holding their respective position. Every last week of any given month, <br>
			the Elite Frontier Tournament is held. All Frontiers can participate in this, and the champion is allowed to challenge <br>
			an Elite Frontier for their position.<br><br>
			At the 1st to 7th of every month, the Elite 4 Promotional Tours are held. This is a Round Robin tournament, held with <br>
			every single Gym Leader and member of the Elite 4 (referred to as "participants" from this point onwards). The four participants<br> 
			with the largest number of wins then proceed to be the Elite 4 for that month. In the case of a tie between two or more members, <br>
			the participant with the lower amount of losses wins. In the case of an absolute tie (same wins, same losses), a Best of 3 set <br>
			is played between the two participants. Participants must register their entire team to an A-Team member for use throughout the <br>
			entire tournament; this is to discourage targetted counterteaming. Registering teams can be done by the 25th of the month following,<br>
			and should be submitted to a member of the Admin Team as soon as possible. Participants may still use a different team to battle<br>
			against challengers, and are allowed to register a new team for next month's tournament.<br><br>
			At the 8th to 14th of every month, the Frontier Promotional Tours are held. Participation in this tournament is completely optional, <br>
			and every Gym Leader of a month or longer is eligible for entry (entrants are referred to as "participants" from this point onwards). <br>
			The Promotional Tour is a Round Robin tournament between all eligible applicants, with the participant of the highest amount of wins <br>
			gains the right to challenge a pre-existing Frontier member for their position. In the case of a tie between two or more members, <br>
			the participant with the lower amount of losses wins. A modified Best of Three set is played between the tournament's victor and the<br>
			challenged Frontier member, with one game being in the participant's tier or format, the second being in the Frontier's, and should <br>
			there be a need for a third game, it will use a format pre-determined by the Frontier Head in charge. Should there be an empty position, <br>
			the participant instead is tested by the Frontier Head. Every participant needs to be ready with a tier or format of their choosing, <br>
			as well as a team built for said tier or format, prior to the tournament itself. <br><br>
